# FormattedNumber

Handle numbers obtained from any string, and arbitrary precision arithmetic.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dlebansais/FormattedNumber.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dlebansais/FormattedNumber) [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/dlebansais/formattednumber/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/dlebansais/formattednumber) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/dlebansais/FormattedNumber/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/dlebansais/FormattedNumber)

This project can be used for the following purposes:

+ Parse any string that could be a number, and extract the relevant parts to obtain 3 substrings:
	* The significand, all characters before the exponent.
	* The exponent, starting after the letter `e`.
	* The invalid end of the string that could not be parsed after the exponent.
+ Perform operations on these parsed numbers with arbitrary precision.

For example, the string `3.141592653589793462643383279502884197169399375105e0X` is parsed as `3.141592653589793462643383279502884197169399375105e`, `0` and `X`. The parsed result can be used to calculate Ï€/2 with a precision of more than 40 digits.

Since a string can always be parsed, and at worse will give two empty strings for the significand and the exponent, with the invalid part being the string itself, it can be used in editors or text viewers that highlight these parts.

For example, the [Easly controller](https://github.com/dlebansais/Easly-Controller) displays the significand with a normal font and color, the exponent with subscript font and normal color, and the invalid part with normal font but red color.

## Non-decimal integers

Programming languages have various ways to deal with numbers expressed in a base different then the usual decimal base. For example, C and C++ use the `0x` prefix to represent hexadecimal numbers. The `FormattedNumber` class uses a suffix:

+ `:H` for hexadecimal,
+ `:O` for octal,
+ `:B` for binary. 

## Leading zeroes

Sometimes having zeroes at the begining of a number is acceptable. Typically, in fixed-length numbers such as hash keys, checksums, unicode key code, and so on. The `FormattedNumber` class handles them with a separate property.

For example, `0C4A9EF2:H` is parsed as one leading zero, significand `C4A9EF2`, empty exponent and empty invalid part.

## Arbitrary precision

The precision at which operations are performed is not infinite, but is arbitrary, and can be tuned using the `Arithmetic` class.

This is done using a fork of [Peter Occil](https://github.com/peteroupc)'s [Numbers](https://github.com/peteroupc/Numbers) project. If you like this software, considered donating at the link provided in the main page of that project.

## Detailed interface

A formatted number can be created in two ways:

+ Parsing a string and extracting the number of leading zeroes, a `Number` object, and the invalid string that follows.
+ Initializing the formatted number directly with:
    * The number of leading zeroes,
    * The `Number` object,
    * The invalid string.

The second method is not terribly interesting, and in what follows we will just focus on parsing.

### Valid numbers

When allowing leading zeroes, they are all removed unless the string is just `0`. If they are not allowed, and the string to parse begins with a zero, and is not `0` itself, it is considered totally invalid. In this case, the returned `Number` object is an instance of `InvalidNumber`.

Once the leading zeroes are handled, the number is parsed as follow:

1. The string `0` gives an instance of `IntegerNumber` with the value 0.
+ A valid significand can start with an optional + or -, and is either an integer or a real number.
	* The string is parsed as a decimal integer.
	* If not a valid decimal integer, and the string ends with a base suffix, it is parsed as an integer in that base.
	* If parsing as an integer failed, the string is parsed as a real number.
+ A real number begins with at least one decimal digit, and is followed by the decimal separator as specified by the current culture. A dot is also always accepted as decimal separator.
+ If there is no decimal separator, digits are parsed to obtain an instance of an `IntegerNumber`, followed by an invalid part.
+ If there is a decimal separator, and digits are not followed by the e or E characters, they are parsed to obtain an instance of a `RealNumber`, with exponent 0, followed by an invalid part.
+ If the exponent character is found, it can optionally be followed by either + or -, and decimal digits (the first digit is not allowed to be 0). Unless this first digit exists, the exponent is not valid and treated as the case above.
+ If found, the exponent is parsed to the last digit. The number is then an instance of `RealNumber` with this exponent, and whatever follows is the invalid string part.

### Reconstructing the string

From an FormattedNumber object, one can reconstruct the original string:

+ Leading zeroes are generated.
+ Each type of Number object generate it's own specific text:
    * An instance of InvalidNumber adds the invalid part directly.
    * An instance of IntegerNumber adds digits, then the (optional) base suffix.
    * An instance of RealNumber adds the significand and exponent parts, then the invalid part.
